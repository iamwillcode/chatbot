# Support Knowledge Bot

## Overview

This is a Tkinter-based support chatbot that uses TinyDB to load a knowledge base extracted from Word (.docx) and PDF (.pdf) documents. It supports fuzzy keyword matching, synonym expansion, tag and file type filtering, chat history, quick FAQ buttons, and keyword highlighting.

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install python-docx pdfplumber tinydb nltk fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein
```

- Download NLTK stopwords (run once in Python shell):

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

### Prepare your documents

- Put your `.docx` and `.pdf` troubleshooting documents in the `docs/` folder.

### Index your documents

Run the `index_documents.py` script to extract paragraphs, generate tags, and create the TinyDB JSON index:

```bash
python index_documents.py
```

### Run the chatbot

Start the chatbot GUI with:

```bash
python support_bot.py
```

## Files

- `index_documents.py` - Script to index your Word/PDF docs into TinyDB JSON.
- `support_bot.py` - The Tkinter GUI chatbot application.
- `synonyms.json` - JSON file containing synonym groups for better matching.
- `docs/` - Folder for your knowledge base documents.
- `data/` - Folder where the TinyDB JSON index is stored.

## Features

- Fuzzy search with synonym expansion.
- Filter by tags and file types.
- Highlighted matched keywords in responses.
- Search history and quick FAQ buttons.
- Export chat to a text file.

Explanation for Your Manager
What is this app?
It‚Äôs a lightweight, offline chatbot designed to assist support agents by quickly searching through troubleshooting documents (Word, PDF) to find relevant solutions.

How does it work?

It indexes all your existing knowledge base documents into a searchable database.

When you type in a question or issue, the bot uses fuzzy keyword matching to find the most relevant information.

It highlights keywords in the results and allows filtering by topics or file type for faster lookup.

The interface is user-friendly with search history and quick FAQ buttons for common issues.

Why offline?

No dependency on internet connectivity or cloud services, so it‚Äôs secure and works anywhere, even without network access.

All data stays on the local machine, ensuring confidentiality.

Can it be updated?

Yes! Adding new troubleshooting documents is as simple as placing them in a folder and running a script that updates the searchable database.

This keeps the knowledge base current without complex retraining or AI model updates.

Benefits for the team:

Speeds up response times by providing immediate access to relevant troubleshooting steps.

Reduces repetitive manual searching across multiple documents.

Easy to maintain and expand with new documents.

No costly AI infrastructure or ongoing cloud fees.

#Prompt to make app

Prompt:

Create a standalone Python application named suretail_support_bot.py using Tkinter for a knowledge base chatbot that feels conversational, fluid, and modern. The app must run on Python 3.13, be offline-compatible after initial setup, and use only open-source libraries: tinydb, fuzzywuzzy, python-Levenshtein, pdfplumber, python-docx, nltk, and pillow. The app should have the following features and design:

Features:

Chat Interface:
A large chat input box (Entry, width=80, font="Helvetica 12") at the bottom of the Chat tab, with Send and Clear buttons always visible (even in smaller windows, min size 800x500).
Pressing Enter triggers the search.
Results display in a scrollable text area (ScrolledText, height=10) with bolded keywords (font="Helvetica 10 bold") and grouped by filename (üìÑ filename headers).
A scrollable FAQ sidebar (using Canvas) on the left for quick question buttons.
Fuzzy Search:
Use fuzzywuzzy for keyword matching (threshold 70%) with synonym expansion from synonyms.json.
Highlight matched words in results (wrap with ** and bold in UI).
Regex Search:
Add a "Regex Search" checkbox to enable pattern-based search (e.g., log* matches ‚Äúlogin,‚Äù ‚Äúlogout‚Äù).
Handle invalid regex patterns with an error message.
Highlight regex matches in results.
Tag/Filetype Filtering:
Dropdowns for tags (from document content/filenames, top 5 words via NLTK) and filetypes (‚ÄúAll,‚Äù ‚Äú.pdf,‚Äù ‚Äú.docx‚Äù).
Filter results based on selected tag/filetype.
Image Display:
Extract images from .docx files (save to images/ with unique names, e.g., <uuid>_img0.png) during indexing.
Display thumbnails (80x80) in a scrollable horizontal gallery (Canvas) below results.
Click thumbnails to open full-size images in the default viewer.
Dark Mode:
Toggle between light (#f4f4f9 background, #007bff buttons) and dark (#2d2d2d background, #1e90ff buttons) themes via a ‚ÄúToggle Dark/Light Mode‚Äù button.
Update all widgets (frames, buttons, text, etc.) dynamically.
Tabs:
Chat: Search, filters, results, image gallery, chatbox.
FAQ Management: Add/edit FAQs in a Treeview (columns: Question, Answer).
Synonym Management: Add/edit comma-separated synonym groups in a Treeview.
Chat History: List previous queries in a Treeview, clickable to re-run, with ‚ÄúExport Chat‚Äù and ‚ÄúClear History‚Äù buttons.
Documents: List indexed document names in a Treeview to prevent duplicates.
Document Indexing:
Index .pdf (via pdfplumber) and .docx files from docs/ or single uploads.
Split PDFs into sentences (>20 chars) and DOCX into paragraphs.
Generate tags using NLTK (word_tokenize, stopwords, top 5 words + filename words).
Store in knowledge_db.json with filename, filetype, text, tags, and image paths.
Prevent duplicate indexing by checking filenames.
Offline Compatibility:
Use local storage (knowledge_db.json, support_bot_db.json, synonyms.json).
Require NLTK data (punkt, stopwords) downloaded once.
UI Design:

Layout: Responsive with grid/pack, weight=1 for scaling, 10px padding.
Typography: Helvetica fonts (10/11/12 for body/labels/headers).
Colors:
Light: background #f4f4f9, text #000000, buttons #007bff (hover #0056b3), text areas #ffffff.
Dark: background #2d2d2d, text #ffffff, buttons #1e90ff (hover #4682b4), text areas #3c3c3c.
Fluidity: Ensure chatbox/buttons remain visible, FAQ sidebar/results/image gallery scrollable, minimum window size 800x500.
Chatbot Feel: Bottom chatbox, FAQ sidebar, bolded keywords, clickable images, and conversational results.
Implementation Details:

Use ttk widgets for consistent styling.
Handle errors (e.g., file processing, regex) with messagebox.
Use Canvas for scrollable FAQ sidebar and image gallery.
Store image references to prevent garbage collection.
Update tag dropdown and document list after indexing.
Export chat history to chat_transcript.txt.
Setup:

Install: pip install tinydb fuzzywuzzy python-Levenshtein pdfplumber python-docx nltk pillow.
Download NLTK: nltk.download('punkt'), nltk.download('stopwords').
Create folders: docs/, data/, images/.
Output:

Provide support_bot.py and README.md with setup/usage instructions.
Ensure no dependencies on fitz, fastapi, or uvicorn.
Test for Python 3.13 compatibility.
Testing:

Verify fuzzy/regex search with keyword highlighting.
Test tag/filetype filtering, image display (.docx), dark mode toggle.
Ensure FAQ/synonym/history/document tabs work, no duplicate indexing.
Confirm fluid UI with visible chatbox/buttons in all window sizes.
