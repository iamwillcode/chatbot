🧱 Step-by-Step Setup for Microsoft Lists
1. Create the List

Go to Microsoft Lists or open it from SharePoint or Teams.
Click “New List” > Blank List.
Name it something like Post-Migration Issues.

2. Add Columns
Match the columns from your Excel sheet:
For the Issues List:

Affected User Name (Text)
Microsoft Ticket (Text)
Agent Name (Person or Text)
Date Reported (Date)
Issue (Choice or Text)
Description (Multiline Text)
Screenshot (Hyperlink or Attachment)
Resolution (Multiline Text)
Extra Notes (Multiline Text)

Optional: Create a second list for Call Logs with its own columns.
3. Customize the Form

Click “New Item” to see the default form.
Use the “Customize with Power Apps” option to build a cleaner, more user-friendly form.
You can add logic like:

Required fields
Conditional visibility
Pre-filled agent name based on login



4. Automate with Power Automate

Trigger a flow when a new item is added.
Actions could include:

Sending a Teams message to your support group
Logging the issue in another list
Sending a confirmation email




🧠 Tips

You can embed the form in Teams for easy access.
Use views and filters to track unresolved issues or first-call resolutions.
Attach screenshots directly to the list item if needed.


Would you like help building the list structure or designing the Power Apps form? I can guide you through it or even generate a sample schema for you to import.

Upload the Excel file to SharePoint or OneDrive.
Go to Microsoft Lists > New List > From Excel.
Select the sheet you want to import (e.g., Post-Migration Issues).
Confirm column types and complete the import.
Repeat for the Call Log sheet if needed.


🔁 Power Automate Flow Overview
Trigger:

When a new message is posted in the designated Teams channel (e.g., Anita).

Steps:


Check for attachments or images

If the message contains a screenshot → set Screenshot Attached? = Yes
Else → set Screenshot Attached? = No



Create a new item in the Microsoft List

Fill in: Affected User Name, Description, Screenshot link (if any), Screenshot Attached?, Date Reported, etc.



Send an Adaptive Card to the Tech Support Group Chat

Card includes:

Issue summary
Screenshot preview (if available)
Button: “Work in Progress”


When clicked:

🧱 Power Apps Integration (Optional but Powerful)
You can build a Power Apps form on top of the Microsoft List to:

View and edit issues in a clean UI
Filter by unresolved issues or assigned agents
Upload screenshots manually if needed
Add resolution notes

🧠 Recommendation for Your Flow
Since you're already storing issues in a Microsoft List:

Store screenshots in SharePoint.
Include the SharePoint link in the list item.
Use that link in the Adaptive Card with a “View Screenshot” button.
