) Prep: confirm the column

In your Combined Log list, make sure screenshot is a Column type = Image (not Hyperlink).

In the list view, add the screenshot column so you‚Äôll see the thumbnail after save.

2) Open the form and unlock the card

Open the customized form in Power Apps Studio.

In the left tree, select the screenshot DataCard (it will be named something like screenshot_DataCard).

In the right pane, click Unlock to change properties (if locked).

3) Add the Add Picture control and map it

Insert ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Add picture. Rename it to AddPic_Screenshot.

Drag/drop AddPic_Screenshot inside screenshot_DataCard.

(Optional) Add an Image control for preview and set:

Image:

If(
  !IsBlank(AddPic_Screenshot.Media),
  AddPic_Screenshot.Media,
  ThisItem.screenshot   // shows the currently stored image when editing existing items
)


With the screenshot_DataCard selected, set Update to:

If(
  !IsBlank(AddPic_Screenshot.Media),
  AddPic_Screenshot.Media,
  Parent.Default
)


This means: if a new picture is chosen, save it; otherwise keep the existing image.

If you want the field required, set the card‚Äôs Required to true.

Tip: The Add Picture control‚Äôs AcceptedFileTypes defaults to images; you can keep it or set ["image/*"].

4) Optional: ‚ÄúClear/Replace image‚Äù UX

Add a small ‚ÄúRemove Screenshot‚Äù toggle or button.

A) Toggle approach

Insert a Toggle named tglClearShot.

Set Text = "Remove screenshot".

Change screenshot_DataCard.Update to:

If(
  tglClearShot.Value,
  Blank(),
  If(!IsBlank(AddPic_Screenshot.Media), AddPic_Screenshot.Media, Parent.Default)
)


After submit (see ¬ß6), reset the toggle:

Reset(tglClearShot); Reset(AddPic_Screenshot)


B) Button approach

Insert a Button ‚ÄúClear‚Äù.

OnSelect:

Reset(AddPic_Screenshot);
UpdateContext({ _clearShot: true });


Modify Update similarly using _clearShot flag.

5) Keep the Attachments control (optional)

If you still want other files (logs, PDFs, extra images) as list attachments:

Leave the Attachments DataCard in the form.

It‚Äôs separate from the screenshot Image column, so both can coexist:

Primary screenshot ‚Üí screenshot (thumbnail in list)

Additional files ‚Üí Attachments

6) Submit/save behavior

You can rely on SharePoint‚Äôs built-in Save button, or add your own:

Submit button (your own)

Insert ‚Üí Button ‚Üí Text: "Submit".

OnSelect:

If(
  SharePointForm1.Valid,
  SubmitForm(SharePointForm1),
  Notify("Please fill in all required fields.", NotificationType.Warning)
)


Form success (optional tidy-up)

SharePointForm1.OnSuccess:

ResetForm(SharePointForm1);
RequestHide(); // closes the form in SharePoint

7) Nice-to-haves (validation & hints)

Make screenshot required only in certain cases (e.g., when ‚ÄúScreenshot Attached?‚Äù = true):

screenshot_DataCard.Required:

ThisItem.'Screenshot Attached?'


Show a hint when no image is present:

Add a Label under the preview:

Text:

If(
  IsBlank(AddPic_Screenshot.Media) && IsBlank(ThisItem.screenshot),
  "No screenshot yet ‚Äî click or drag a file above.",
  ""
)


Limit file size (SharePoint limits apply; typical max 10‚Äì15 MB for images). You can guard:

AddPic_Screenshot OnAddFile:

If(
  AddPic_Screenshot.AddedFiles[0].Size > 10*1024*1024,
  Notify("Image too large (max 10 MB).", NotificationType.Error);
  Reset(AddPic_Screenshot)
)

8) Publish and test

File ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Publish to SharePoint ‚Üí Publish.

From your Adaptive Card, click üìù Open List Item (EditForm.aspx?ID=‚Ä¶).

Use Add picture to pick a screenshot, Submit.

Back in the list grid, confirm the screenshot column shows a thumbnail.
(If you don‚Äôt see it, add the column to your current view.)

Quick Troubleshooting

No thumbnail in list: Ensure you updated the Image column (screenshot) ‚Äî not just Attachments or a Hyperlink column. Confirm the view displays screenshot.

Image didn‚Äôt save: Verify screenshot_DataCard.Update exactly as above, and that AddPic_Screenshot sits inside the card.

Editing existing item shows old image: That‚Äôs correct if you didn‚Äôt pick a new one. Use the Remove flow (toggle/button) to clear, then submit.

Multiple screenshots: The Image column stores one picture. Keep Attachments for additional images; or add screenshot_2 (another Image column) if you want a second primary image.




Do this (works 100% even when ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù is hidden)

Confirm control names

Your form is likely SharePointForm1.

Your Add Picture control is whatever you named it (e.g., AddPic_Screenshot). If you haven‚Äôt added it yet: Insert ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Add picture; put it inside the screenshot card.

Put this in the form‚Äôs OnSuccess

Select the form (click the gray border until the property dropdown shows SharePointForm1).

In the top-left property dropdown, pick OnSuccess.

Paste this formula:

// After SubmitForm succeeds, push the chosen image into the Image column
If(
    !IsBlank(AddPic_Screenshot.Media),
    Patch(
        'Combined Log',
        If(
            !IsBlank(SharePointForm1.LastSubmit),
            SharePointForm1.LastSubmit,
            LookUp('Combined Log', ID = SharePointIntegration.SelectedListItemID)
        ),
        { screenshot: AddPic_Screenshot.Media }
    )
);

// optional tidy-up
Reset(AddPic_Screenshot);
RequestHide()


If your Add Picture control has a different name, replace AddPic_Screenshot accordingly.

Make sure SubmitForm is being called

If you rely on the built-in SharePoint ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button, it already calls SubmitForm(SharePointForm1) ‚Üí your OnSuccess runs automatically.

If you added your own button, set OnSelect to:

If(SharePointForm1.Valid, SubmitForm(SharePointForm1), Notify("Please fill required fields.", NotificationType.Warning))
