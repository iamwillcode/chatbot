1) Turn your list form into a Power Apps form

Open your Combined Log list in SharePoint.

Top bar → Integrate → Power Apps → Customize forms.
Power Apps opens with a form connected to Combined Log.

In the left tree, select SharePointForm1 (that’s the default edit/display form).

Publish later in step 6.

2) Show the right fields & order them

In the right pane (Fields), Add and Reorder:

Affected User Name (Text)

Microsoft Ticket (Text)

Agent Name (Person)

Date Reported (Date/Time)

Issue (Choice/Text)

Description (Multiline)

Attachments (very important—lets techs add screenshots)

Screenshot (Hyperlink) (optional to display; attachments usually cover uploads)

Screenshot Attached? (Yes/No)

Resolution (Multiline)

Extra Notes (Multiline)

Logged on Issues Tab? (Yes/No)

Resolved 1st Call? (Yes/No)

Link to user message (Hyperlink)

To add Attachments if it’s not visible: click + Add field, choose Attachments.

3) Make it friendly (visibility, defaults, & validation)

Select each DataCard and set properties (top-left dropdown → DataCard).

3.1 Required rules

Issue required:

Select Issue_DataCard → Required: true

Description required:

Description_DataCard → Required: true

3.2 Conditional logic

If Screenshot Attached? = true, highlight attachments:

Attachments_DataCard → Visible: true

Attachments_DataCard → BorderColor:

If( ThisItem.'Screenshot Attached?', ColorValue("#ff9800"), RGBA(0,0,0,0) )


If Resolved 1st Call? = true, Resolution_DataCard → Required:

ThisItem.'Resolved 1st Call?'


(Or show a banner label with a reminder:

"Please add Resolution when 'Resolved 1st Call?' is Yes."


and set Visible to the same condition.)

3.3 Helpful defaults (optional)

These don’t override existing values—only help new records (you’re editing after creation, so mostly informational):

Date Reported → Default:

If( IsBlank(Parent.Default), Now(), Parent.Default )

3.4 Lock/unlock cards to edit inner controls

Select a DataCard → Unlock (if needed) to edit Default/Update/DisplayMode of inner controls.

Keep Update as the inner control’s Text (or Selected for choice/person), e.g.:

Text fields: DataCardValue_Issue.Text

Yes/No: DataCardValue_SAAttch.Value

Person: keep default binding—Power Apps handles it.

4) Attachments for screenshots

The Attachments control lets techs browse or drag/drop image files.

Screenshots become list attachments (which is fine for Option 1).

If you also want to display the Screenshot (Hyperlink) field:

Add a label below:
Text:

If( IsBlank( ThisItem.Screenshot.Value ), "No screenshot link", "Screenshot link added" )


Or add a Launch icon with OnSelect:

If( !IsBlank( ThisItem.Screenshot.Value ), Launch( ThisItem.Screenshot.Value ) )

5) Layout & polish (quick wins)

Use Containers → Vertical container to group fields (Issue/Description together, Resolution/Notes together).

Add a small Label at the top showing the Teams link:

Text: "🔗 Open Teams message"

OnSelect (set DisplayMode = View, and OnSelect to launch):

If( !IsBlank(ThisItem.'Link to user message'.Value), Launch(ThisItem.'Link to user message'.Value) )


Add a banner label at top:

Text:

Concatenate("Affected User: ", Coalesce(ThisItem.'Affected User Name', ""))

6) Publish & use

File → Save → Publish to SharePoint → Publish.

Back in SharePoint, open any item → you’ll see your Power Apps form.

Your Adaptive Card “📝 Open List Item” button doesn’t change:

It already links to:
…/Lists/Combined%20Log/EditForm.aspx?ID=<ID>

That now opens the Power Apps form automatically.

7) Flow: no change needed (verify the link)

In your flow’s Compose — ListItemUrl, keep:

concat(
  variables('varSiteUrl'),
  '/Lists/Combined%20Log/EditForm.aspx?ID=',
  variables('varListItemId')
)


The Adaptive Card 📝 Open List Item points here.

Techs edit and Submit—the list updates instantly.

8) Permissions (don’t skip)

Make sure the support team has at least Contribute to:

Combined Log list (to edit)

(Optional) any associated document library if you also link to uploaded files elsewhere.

9) Quick test plan (5 minutes)

Post in Teams (with/without attachments).

Flow creates list item and posts Adaptive Card.

Click 📝 Open List Item → Power Apps form opens.

Add a screenshot via Attachments, fill Resolution and Extra Notes, toggle Screenshot Attached? as needed.

Click Save → confirm list item updated.

Click 🛠️ Work in Progress in the card → confirm Agent Name fills in the list; chat and channel notifications land.

Later: switch to a full app (no URL change)

When you want a richer experience, you can still move to a standalone Power Apps app and change only the ListItemUrl in your flow to the app’s deep link (…/play/appId/...&ID=<ID>). Everything else stays the same.
